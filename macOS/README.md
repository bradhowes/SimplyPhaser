# About

This holds the three directories that define the build artifacts for macOS. There is a matching set in the [iOS](../iOS)
folder.

* [App](App) — the executable that runs and as a side-effect installs the AUv3 app extension onto the macOS device
* [Extension](Extension) — the AUv3 app extension that is packaged with the application

All of the functionality that is shared with the iOS app is found in the Swift packages folder.
